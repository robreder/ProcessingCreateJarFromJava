ProcessingCreateJarFromJava
## Extra needed files
core.jar has to be added to this folder to use the script.
If you want to use this run script you also need your special Java-Source-File with a main-method.
## Instructions
Check the file MainClass.java to know how you have to write a file with processing.
The run script is now building this MainClass.java file and creats a dist folder 
afterwards with the compiled class files added to a jar-file.
Beside the jar-file it also places the needed core.jar library to the lib folder.
Then it runs the application.


If you want to use a different java file you have to adopt the variables in the run script.
